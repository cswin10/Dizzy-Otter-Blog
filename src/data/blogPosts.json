    "title": "The Beginning of Dizzy Otter Ltd: A New Chapter in My Journey",
    "content": "This marks the beginning of an exciting journey—one that I have been working towards for a long time. Starting my own company has always been a goal, but I never expected the path that would lead me here. After discovering a passion for coding, I stumbled upon web development, and what started as a personal interest quickly became a career-defining pursuit.\n\nWeb development has already taken me on an incredible adventure, opening doors I never imagined would be possible this early on. What began as an exploration of coding has evolved into something far bigger: Dizzy Otter Ltd.\n\nHow Dizzy Otter Ltd Came to Be\n\nDizzy Otter Ltd was originally born out of necessity—I needed to register a business to get paid for my first official freelance project. But from that moment, it became more than just a side project. Over the last few months, I’ve had the privilege of working with startups, established businesses, and sole traders, all looking for ways to improve their online presence. Whether it was enhancing their visibility to attract new clients, optimising their websites for SEO, or leveraging AI tools to streamline their operations, I realised there was a real demand for these services.\n\nIt became clear that many businesses in my local area struggled with their digital presence, marketing strategies, and SEO. Many were missing out on opportunities simply because they weren’t maximising the potential of their websites or online platforms. That’s where Dizzy Otter Ltd comes in. My company is positioned to help businesses—both small and large—adapt to the digital age, expand their reach, and take advantage of modern technology to stay competitive.\n\nWhy This Blog?\n\nThis blog will document the journey of Dizzy Otter Ltd as I grow both as a web developer and as the CEO of my own company. I’ll be sharing insights, experiences, and lessons learned along the way.\n\nExpect posts on:\n✔ Starting and scaling a business – What works, what doesn’t, and what I’ve learned firsthand.\n✔ Web design and development – Tips, tools, and best practices for creating high-quality websites.\n✔ SEO and online marketing – How to make your business stand out in search engines and attract customers.\n✔ Freelancing and client work – The challenges of working with businesses, setting rates, and managing projects.\n✔ AI and technology in business – How businesses can leverage AI to improve efficiency and innovation.\n\nIf you’re thinking about starting your own business, getting into design or programming, or simply looking for practical tips to enhance your existing business, this blog is for you.\n\nThis is just the beginning of what I hope will be an incredible journey. If you’re interested in web development, tech, or business, I’d love to have you follow along. Let’s build something great together.",
